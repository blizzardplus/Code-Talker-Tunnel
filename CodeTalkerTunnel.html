	<p>
	Code Talker Tunnel (previously called SkypeMorph) is a protocol camouflaging tool, designed to reshape traffic output of any censorship circumvention tool to look like Skype video calls. Our software can be used as a SOCKS proxy and therefore it is extremely easy to use it with different anonymity and censorship resistance tools.
